# scParadize
Tunable highly accurate multi-task cell type annotation and surface protein abundance prediction

scParadise is a fast, tunable, high-throughput automatic cell type annotation and modality prediction framework. scParadise includes three sets of tools: scAdam - fast multi-task multi-class cell type annotation; scEve - modality prediction; scNoah - benchmarking cell type annotation and modality prediction. scParadise enables users to utilize a selection of pre-existing models (scAdam or scEve) as well as to develop and train custom models tailored to specific research needs. scNoah facilitates the evaluation of novel models and methods for automated cell type annotation and modality prediction in scRNA-seq analysis.

# Installation
## Using pip
```console
pip install scparadise
