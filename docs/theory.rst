This section aims to clarify the key concepts that underpin the operation of the scParadise library. Below are the characteristics of the scAdam and scEve models. Additionally, the quality control metrics used by scNoah are explained.

Model
*****
A machine learning model is a computational framework or program that has been trained to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data. It is the result of applying a machine learning algorithm to a dataset, allowing the model to learn from the data and generalize its knowledge to new, unseen instances.

Key Characteristics

1. Training: Machine learning models are created through a training process where they learn from data. During this phase, the algorithm optimizes its parameters to minimize prediction errors, resulting in a model capable of making accurate predictions.

2. Types of Learning:
  * Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data, where each input is paired with the correct output (e.g., classification tasks).
  *	Unsupervised Learning: The model learns from unlabeled data to identify patterns or groupings without explicit instructions (e.g., clustering).
  *	Semi-Supervised Learning: Combines labeled and unlabeled data for training, enhancing performance when labeled data is limited.
  *	Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

3. Output: Once trained, a machine learning model can make predictions on new data. For example, it can classify images, predict numerical values, or recognize speech based on previously unseen inputs.

4. Storage: Machine learning models can be saved as files or objects, allowing them to be reused for future predictions without needing retraining.
